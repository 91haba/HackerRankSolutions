# HackerRankSolutions
This is a repo for HackerRankSolutions with Swift

Different folders are named after those domain names or contest names.

# Usage

I created class for each problem. If you want to test those solution on HackerRank, please follow this guideline.

1. create a constant with class name.

        let mySolution = MyClass()
2. call *solution* method on that constant

        mySolution.solution()
3. copy and paste related helper methods from *HackerRankHelper* folder, eg. *getLine()*, *getInt()*

# Note

All those solution I wrote used Swift1.2, since HackerRank only supports Swift1.* for now. But it is not a big deal since those solutions usually don't need too much new language features.
